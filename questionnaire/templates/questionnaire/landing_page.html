        <p>
            I am Estelle Hlustik-Smith, an undergraduate Geography student at the University of Oxford. 
            For my dissertation I am investigating perceptions surrounding street art and would be very grateful if you could complete my 10-15 min survey on the topic. You do not need to have any artistic background or even like street art, all opinions are welcome. 
            Please read the information sheet and consent form below and then proceed to the questions. 
            Thank you very much for your time. <br><br><b>The survey will only work on a laptop/desktop, sorry for any inconvenience.</b>

        <p><b>1. What is the purpose of this research? </b><br>I am conducting research for my undergraduate geography dissertation. I aim to explore how the political implications, emotive impacts and value of street art are perceived to be transformed and compromised when it is removed from the street and displayed elsewhere. I shall explore this through the case study of ‘Big Mother’ by STIK.</p>
        <p><b>2. Why have I been invited to take part?</b><br>You have been invited to take part to gauge the public perceptions and reactions to street art. Anyone over 18 is welcome to participate, regardless of knowledge or interest in the subject.</p>
        <p><b>3. Do I have to take part?</b><br>No.  You can ask questions about the research before deciding whether or not to participate by contacting estelle.hlustik-smith@st-annes.ox.ac.uk. If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason, by closing your web browser window before pressing submit or advising the researchers of this decision.</p>
